## What is this repository?

This is a fork based on [j-hc repo](https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module) with a little twists/improvements of my own.

## What are the difference of this fork?

There is not much, but these are some that i like:

* Upstream repository sync
* Secret `client_id` token
* Support replacing _signing keystore_

## Why there are no releases unlike on the [j-hc/revanced-magisk-module repo](https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module)?

If you have granted the access, you can also generate the template from these repositories:
